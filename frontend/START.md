# ✅ Frontend Setup - VERIFIED WORKING

## Status: READY TO USE

The frontend setup is complete and tested. The dev server is running.

## Quick Start

### Method 1: Use the helper script
```bash
/home/tensae/Desktop/projects/stadipass/frontend/dev.sh
```

### Method 2: Direct command
```bash
cd /home/tensae/Desktop/projects/stadipass/frontend
npm run dev
```

### Method 3: Full path (if terminal has issues)
```bash
cd /home/tensae/Desktop/projects/stadipass/frontend && npm run dev
```

## Access the App

The dev server should be running on:
- **http://localhost:5173**

If port 5173 is busy, Vite will automatically use the next available port (5174, 5175, etc.)

## What's Working

✅ React + Vite + TypeScript configured  
✅ Tailwind CSS working  
✅ All dependencies installed  
✅ Build verified working  
✅ TypeScript compilation clean  
✅ Folder structure ready  

## Test Results

- ✅ Production build: SUCCESS
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: SUCCESS  
- ✅ All dependencies: INSTALLED
- ✅ Configuration files: VERIFIED
- ✅ Linter: NO ERRORS

## Next Steps

Once you verify the dev server is running, we can:
1. Plan the roadmap together
2. Start building features step by step
3. Begin with authentication pages or UI components
